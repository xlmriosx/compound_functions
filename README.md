# Compound Functions

## Definition

The function composed of any two functions f(x) and g(x) is defined, and designated by (g o f)(x), the function that transforms x into g [f(x)]:

f(x) = sin(X)

g(x) = x**2

Where (g o f)(x) it's readed like f composed with g.

The compound function is one that is obtained through an operation called composition of functions, which consists of applying successively the functions that are part of the operation. Thus, the composite function of f (x) and g (x) is another function obtained by applying g to the images of f.

The codomain of the first function is included in the domain of the second. In this case the domain of the compound function coincides with that of the first function.

The codomain of the first function is not included in the domain of the second. In this case, the domain of the compound function would be those values of the first function that are anti-image of the values of the domain of the second:

## Properties

### No commutative 

That is, as we had previously indicated, the order in which we apply the composition generally conditions the result obtained.

Then: (g o f) <> (f o g)

(g o f)

(f o g)

### Asociative

That is, given any 3 functions, the same result is obtained by composing the first (f) and the second (g), and later composing the result with the third (h), than composing the second (g) and the third (h) and later composing the first (f) with the result obtained.

Then: (g o f) o h = g o (f o h)

(g o f) o h

g o (f o h)

### Neutral element

The neutral element of an operation is the one that, when operated with any element, leaves it the same, that is, the one that makes the operation have a neutral effect. In the case of the composition of functions, the neutral element is the identity function I(x) = x.

Then: (f o 1) = f
